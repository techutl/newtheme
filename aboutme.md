About Me

Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m Neha Johari, a passionate technocrat with over 13 years of experience in IT Project Management, navigating the complexities of technology to deliver impactful solutions.

Professionally, I hold certifications like PMP and PMI-ACP, and specialize in translating ambitious ideas into actionable projects. My journey spans diverse roles—from leading agile teams at CDAC Noida to ensuring seamless collaboration between technical and business teams.

Outside of work, I’m a proud wife and the mother of two beautiful daughters. We live in Noida, where I balance my professional pursuits with my love for music and fitness. Staying active and embracing the rhythm of life keeps me inspired both at work and home.

Join me here as I share professional insights, personal anecdotes, and thoughts on balancing a fulfilling career with a vibrant life beyond the desk.

Let’s innovate, inspire, and grow together!
